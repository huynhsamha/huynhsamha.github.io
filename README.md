## Development
Running on local with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

### Quickstart with new app
```bash
# Install packages by Gem
gem install bundler jekyll

# If you have some error on Ubuntu
# maybe should install package ruby-dev
# because ruby on Ubuntu is old
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev

jekyll new my-awesome-site
cd my-awesome-site

bundle exec jekyll serve
# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
```
